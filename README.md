# LogoLabs:   Logo Generator

## Description 
LogoLabs is a command-line application that enables users to generate logos for their brand or company by inputting information on shapes, colors and text.  The application supports three types of shapes, including squares, circles and triangles and allows users to specify the color of the shape using a hexadecimal value or a pre-defined color name.  Users are prompted to add text to the logo and the color of the text.

The LogoLabs application is user-friendly and provides clear instructions on how to use the application.  Once the user inputs the necessary information, LogoLabs generates a high-quality logo in an SVG format.  This allows users to easily incorporate their logo into their marketing materials, website and social media profiles.

Overall, LogoLabs is a powerful tool for anyone who wants to create a professional-looking logo for their brand or company quickly and easily. With its simplistic approach to creating your new logo, LogoLabs is an excellent choice for both beginners and experienced designers alike.
